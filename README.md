Emotion and personality are central elements in understanding human psychological states. 
Existing affective computing datasets often annotate emotion and personality traits separately, lacking fine-grained labeling of micro-emotions
and emotion intensity in both single-label and multi-label classifications.
Chinese emotion datasets are extremely scarce, and datasets capturing Chinese users’ personality traits are even more limited. 
To address these gaps, this study collected data from the major social media platform Weibo, 
screening 11,338 valid users from over 50,000 individuals with diverse MBTI personality labels and acquiring 566,900 posts along with the users’ MBTI personality tags.
Using the EQN method, we compiled a multi-label Chinese affective computing dataset that integrates the same users' personality traits with six emotions and micro-emotions, 
each annotated with intensity levels. Validation results across multiple NLP classification models demonstrate the dataset’s strong utility.
This dataset is designed to advance machine recognition of complex human emotions and provide data support for research in psychology, education, marketing, finance, and politics.

Although this dataset has undergone privacy protection measures, it involves research on human personality and emotions. 
To ensure user safety, CMACD is made available free of charge only to researchers with a legitimate need. 
Researchers wishing to use CMACD can apply by emailing: annezjy94@163.com.
To demonstrate the features and application value of this dataset, and to facilitate basic testing and feedback, we have made a small sample of CMACD publicly available.
