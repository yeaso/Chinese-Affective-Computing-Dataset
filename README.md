集MBTI（人格类型）+情绪+微情绪+情绪强度的大型数据集。
数据集分两个：1. 基于真实微博信息的集MBTI（人格类型）+情绪+微情绪+情绪强度的大型数据集（CMACD）（该数据集仅开放小样本免费使用）。
2. GPT学习真实微博用户帖子后，生成模拟用户风格的内容作为数据集样本。集MBTI（人格类型）+情绪+微情绪+情绪强度的数据集（CPME）（该数据集完全开放，免费学习研究使用）。
两种数据集优缺点：
1. CMACD 真实风格，数据噪音大，分类效果不如CPME。适于商业化应用。
2. CPME 模拟用户风格，数据规范、质量高，分类效果显著优于 CMACD。但在语言灵活表达和话题的丰富多样方面，存在局限。适合科学研究和模型训练。

A large-scale dataset integrating MBTI (personality types) + emotion + micro-emotion + emotion intensity.

The dataset is divided into two parts:
CMACD: A large-scale dataset based on real Weibo posts, containing MBTI (personality types) + emotion + micro-emotion + emotion intensity. (This dataset is only partially open to the public, with a small sample available for free use.)
CPME: A dataset generated by GPT after learning from real Weibo user posts, simulating user-style content as sample data. It includes MBTI (personality types) + emotion + micro-emotion + emotion intensity. (This dataset is fully open and free for academic research and learning purposes.)

Pros and Cons of the Two Datasets:
CMACD: Reflects authentic user styles but contains more noise, and its classification performance is not as strong as CPME. Suitable for commercial applications.
CPME: Simulates user styles with standardized and high-quality data, and significantly outperforms CMACD in classification tasks. However, it has limitations in flexible language expression and topic diversity. Best suited for scientific research and model training.

Emotion and personality are central elements in understanding human psychological states. 
Existing affective computing datasets often annotate emotion and personality traits separately, lacking fine-grained labeling of micro-emotions
and emotion intensity in both single-label and multi-label classifications.
Chinese emotion datasets are extremely scarce, and datasets capturing Chinese users’ personality traits are even more limited. 
To address these gaps, this study collected data from the major social media platform Weibo, 
screening 11,338 valid users from over 50,000 individuals with diverse MBTI personality labels and acquiring 566,900 posts along with the users’ MBTI personality tags.
Using the EQN method, we compiled a multi-label Chinese affective computing dataset that integrates the same users' personality traits with six emotions and micro-emotions, 
each annotated with intensity levels. Validation results across multiple NLP classification models demonstrate the dataset’s strong utility.
This dataset is designed to advance machine recognition of complex human emotions and provide data support for research in psychology, education, marketing, finance, and politics.
